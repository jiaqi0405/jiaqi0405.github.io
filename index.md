## About Me

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Telecommunication Engineering, where I developed a strong foundation in telecommunications, signal processing, and embedded systems. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work on various projects that honed my technical skills, including developing wireless communication systems and exploring the integration of hardware and software in complex network environments.

Currently, I am an Msc Robotics student at the University of Manchester, where I am expanding my expertise in areas such as machine learning, autonomous systems, and computer vision.

Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a passion for innovation and problem-solving, and I look forward to applying my skills in real-world applications, particularly in the fields of  robotics.
